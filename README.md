# Master thesis for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology

This repository contains the code of my master thesis for the University Master Degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the Autonomous University of Madrid. 

**A book with the master thesis code is available at https://dariolez.github.io/master-thesis-bioinformatics**.

## Brief description

The master thesis consisted in the analysis of a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset from the following scientific publication:

> Madissoon, E., Wilbrey-Clark, A., Miragaia, R.J. et al. scRNA-seq assessment of the human lung, spleen, and esophagus tissue stability after cold preservation. Genome Biol 21, 1 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1906-x

I have prepared a Quarto Book with the code that was used during the master thesis. You can view it online using the link above. You can also download or clone the repository locally and execute the file in the path `docs/index.html` to visualize the book.

## Repository structure

The repository holds:

- the necessary files to generate the Quarto book.
- the MultiQC quality control results in the folder `quality_control_results`.
- all of the individual scripts that were used in the folder `scripts`.
